Quickstart
==========

The Ralph Assets module enables management of assets, licences and supports.
Any objects in this modules allows manage relation beetween them. This
quickstart assumes that you installed ralph with the demo data.


Assets
^^^^^^

On the main Assets' page you can see some demo hardware assets. Note that they
are not discovered i.e. they are added to the database but ralph scan didn't
discover them in the network.

Adding new assets
--------------------------

We start by adding two similar assets.

1. Click "Add device"

2. Fill the form with the following data

.. image:: _static/ralph_quick_start_add_assets.png
    :width: 600px

- **Basic info:**

    - Model:  PowerEdge Rxxx (HP) (Server Rack)
    - Warehouse: Warsaw
    - Service catalog: Databases
    - Environment: Prod
    - Region: Default Region
    - Hostname: localhost 
    - IP address: 127.0.0.1
- **Financial info:**
    - Price: 2000
    - Deprecation rate: 25
    - Invoice date: Enter yesterday's date
- **Additional info:**
    - Data center: DC A
    - Server room: Server room A
    - Orientation: front
    - Position: 1

- SN/SNs::
  12345
  67890
- Barcode/Barcodes::
  12345
  67890

Note that in real-world cases if you use barcodes and a scanner it is easy to
enter several assets with common model using the scanner to fill in "SN" and
"Barcode" fields.




Searching and Filtering of Assets
---------------------------------

In the search form on the left 

Let's start with the main screen. Here you find all your hardware assets which
are in the database. Use the left column for filtering of the assets.

There are two types of assets -- devices and parts. A device could be a blade
server, and a part is a component of this server, for example memory or hard
disk drive. A part can be assigned to a single device at a time. You can move
parts from one device to another when you need it.


Adding Assets
-------------

The serial number or barcode field is required for assets.
You can paste serial numbers and barcodes in series,
thus allowing you to batch-add many devices of the same type.


Adding Parts
------------

In the same way you can add parts to the database, and then bind the parts to
devices. To do this, choose "Add part" from the menu.

propagate this value to all records by clicking on the "plus" mark near the
current cell.


Work Flow and Statues
